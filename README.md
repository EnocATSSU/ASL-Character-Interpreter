# ASL-Character-Interpreter
American Sign Language Character Interpreter, which allows a user to speak by clicking a button and have the audio input converted into ASL and viceversa.

Note: If the IDE being used does not ask for mic or camera permission, run it through the terminal. (Mic and camera permissions are needed for the program).

To get started, after pulling the code, run the Intro-window.py file. This will run the initial welcome page, from which the user will be redirected. After this, the main window will appear. The user can click on the speak button, and say a word between 1 and five letters long, and after five seconds, the asl characters for it will be displayed on the right side of the screen. 

After clicking on the camera button, the camera will open and everytime the user does a handsign, this will analyze and say which English corresponding letter the user just hand signed. To turn off the camera, click on the camera button again.
